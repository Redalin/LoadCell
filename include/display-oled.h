  This is an example for our Monochrome OLEDs based on SSD1306 drivers. Pick one up today in the adafruit shop! ------> http://www.adafruit.com/category/63_98
  This example is for a 128x32 pixel display using I2C to communicate 3 pins are required to interface (two I2C and one reset).

// `voltage` is the measured battery voltage (single cell):
// 2.8V = empty, 4.2V = full. If voltage >= ~4.9V treat as external USB (show bolt).
